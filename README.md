Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. 
What user needs was this app designed to address?
The Weight Tracking App is designed to help users achieve their goals. These goals include monitoring of weight, modifying lifestyle and motivation.
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? 
The screens and features that were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app are:
•	Login screen
•	Daily weight display
•	Screen to enter daily weight
How did your UI designs keep users in mind? 
My Ui design kept users in mind by being simple, easy to use and navigate, accessible while providing positive motivation.
Why were your designs successful?
My design is successful because it is intuitive, easy to navigate, and user can easily see and review their progress in real time.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? 
To code my app the first thing  I did was to set up the project (create new project) in Android Studio, then I navigated through the UI design, then the writing of the application logic, followed by testing and upon completion of all those steps publishing.
What techniques or strategies did you use? 
The strategies  I used includes:
•	Planning the features that I would like the app to have.
•	Design UI/UX
•	Use best practices to write clean functional code

How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
In the future these strategies will be applied to my work by ensuring that I thoroughly plan, build, and execute my code in-order for the users to have a seamless and memorable experience.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? 
I tested my code using the Android Studio Emulator, this allowed me to test the app on a  virtual device that simulate different screen sizes, 
Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
This is important and reveals:
•	All the bugs early in the development process.
•	Ensures app computability across different devices
•	Verify software/hardware interactions
Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
When creating the full app design, I had to innovate when showing specific architectural patterns for different screen sizes, orientation, and resolution.
In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was successfully  in demonstrating my knowledge of creating a mobile app when building interactive screens with JAVA/XML.
